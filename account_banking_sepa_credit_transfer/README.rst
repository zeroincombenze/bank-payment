Account Banking SEPA Credit Transfer
====================================

Module to export payment orders in SEPA XML file format.

SEPA PAIN (PAyment INitiation) is the new european standard for
Customer-to-Bank payment instructions. This module implements SEPA Credit
Transfer (SCT), more specifically PAIN versions 001.001.02, 001.001.03,
001.001.04 and 001.001.05. It is part of the ISO 20022 standard, available on
http://www.iso20022.org.

The Implementation Guidelines for SEPA Credit Transfer published by the
European Payments Council (http://http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu) use
PAIN version 001.001.03, so it's probably the version of PAIN that you should
try first.

It also includes pain.001.003.03 which is used in Germany instead of 001.001.03.
You can read more about this here (only in german language):
