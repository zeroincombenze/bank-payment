This addons contains the legacy infrastructure for autocompletion of IBANs
and BBANs.

The autocompletion was implemented for Dutch IBANs, but as it turns out
the online database that it consults does not get updated. As a result,
the autocompletion will come up with outdated IBANs and BICs.

This module is deprecated and will be dropped in OpenERP 8.0.
