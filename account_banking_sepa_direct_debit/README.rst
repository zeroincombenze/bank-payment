Account Banking SEPA Direct Debit

Create SEPA files for Direct Debit

Module to export direct debit payment orders in SEPA XML file format.

SEPA PAIN (PAyment INitiation) is the new european standard for
Customer-to-Bank payment instructions. This module implements SEPA Direct
Debit (SDD), more specifically PAIN versions 008.001.02, 008.001.03 and
008.001.04. It is part of the ISO 20022 standard, available on
http://www.iso20022.org.

The Implementation Guidelines for SEPA Direct Debit published by the European
Payments Council (http://http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu) use PAIN
version 008.001.02. So if you don't know which version your bank supports, you
should try version 008.001.02 first.

* account_banking_pain_base
* account_banking_mandate

This module is part of the OCA/bank-payment suite.

Configuration

Payment Method *SEPA Direct Debit for customers* (which is automatically

uses the proper version of PAIN.

In the menu *Accounting > Payments > Debit Order*, create a new debit
order and select the Payment Mode dedicated to SEPA Direct Debit that
you created during the configuration step.
